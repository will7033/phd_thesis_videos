### Exploration of 3D magnetic vector field with different sampling budgets
These videos demonstrate the exploration of Mag-Follow as it navigates a 3D magnetic vector field. The left figure shows the ground truth of this field. The right figure shows the field being continuously updated as more samples are acquired and the recursive Gaussian Process in Mag-Follow becomes more informed. A selection of sampling budgets show how the inferred field becomes more accurate as more samples are obtained.
